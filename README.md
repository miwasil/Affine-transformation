# Affine-transformations

App written in a team in Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Math) for Numerical-Methods course at AGH UST, ICT - 3rd semester.

## About

The application calculates affine transformations- translation, reflection, scale, rotation and shear on the cube (coordinates included in the file) and hand-generated perlin noise. 
NumPy is used to perform actions on matrices. Matplotlib is used to create readable graphs.

## Illustrative cases

Cube before and after rotation around the center by 45 degrees:
